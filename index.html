<!-- Methodology-->

 <!-- The Tour Section -->
 <div class="w3-black" id="tour">
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">Methodology</h2>
    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-wide w3-center">Data Pre-processing</h2>
    <p >Project:
                 All acquired data were projected to the same NAD 1983 UTM Zone 18N projection as the Study Area. This preprocessing step was necessary to ensure the accuracy of the results during the analysis stage. Criteria that were dependent on the properties derived from the data – included (but were not limited to) distance, length, area, orientation, angle, and slope – required an appropriate projection to obtain accurate results.</p>
<p>Clip: All acquired data was clipped to the extent of the Conservancy’s AOI. This improved efficiency by creating a new geographic subset of features that were within the boundary of the Study Area – which avoided time-consuming or size-limiting issues due to unnecessarily substantial amounts of data during the analysis stage. The data was processed by utilizing the “Clip” tool for the vector data and the “Clip Raster” tool for the raster data.</p>
    <p>Attribute Table Edits:
      The attribute tables for each of the Conservancy’s datasets were updated with added “Land_Type” fields and populated with their respective attributions to retain information that was useful to the Conservancy for later potential querying (“Canadian Shield” vs “Mixed Wood” land types), prior to the merging stage.</p>
    <p> Merge:
      The OIH data was separated into Southwest and Southeast datasets that required merging the Southwest with their Southeast counterparts to create singular Enforced DEM, and Enhanced Flow Direction. This processing step was important for the efficiency and organization of the collective data for the analysis stage. The Conservancy’s data was separated into “Canadian Shield” and “Mixed Wood” datasets that were also merged.</p>
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-wide w3-center">Watershed / Headwater Analysis</h2>
    <p > The following flow chart graphic outlines the basic procedure that was followed to process the DEM to create the quaternary watershed (catchment) and headwater data layers. Please note that the term quaternary watershed has been used in association with size and naming of Ontario Provincial standards.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-wide w3-center">Development of Map Viewer</h2>

   <p>The development process for the viewer had different stages which includes Data Preparation, Web Map Development, Web Application Development and Layout/Design. 

    Data Preparation typically included tasks such as deploying required layers TO web environment, implementing access restrictions to ensure privacy.
    In the web map development phase, defining scale dependencies, cartographic visualization,  symbolizing layers, and configuring attribute querying through pop-ups were implemented.
    Finally, During the web app development phase, widgets were configured to enhance functionality, and layout and design elements were customized.

    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-wide w3-center">Cartographic Visualization</h2>

   <p>Cartographic choices have been carefully considered and applied using qualitative cartographic color conventions to enhance the clarity and legibility of the map. The selection of colors serves to represent different features and elements on the map.

        <p >The watershed analysis conducted for this project yielded expected outcomes, with catchments delineated at the highest points of the terrain and headwater catchments identified in areas with elevated topography. However, some minor adjustments were made during the analysis to tailor the output dataset according to the client's requirements. These modifications primarily involved refining the stream network dataset by excluding first order streams that were less than a total of five kilometers in length and eliminating catchments from the analysis that were smaller than 2 square kilometers in area. These changes were implemented based on a careful examination of the data, both visually and geographically, to ensure that the resulting headwater dataset was narrowed down to specifically address the client's needs. It was important to differentiate between shorter stream segments associated with smaller catchments, which could represent ephemeral or intermittent streams, rather than strictly adhering to the definition of headwater as first order streams, as defined for this analysis.</p>

      <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:9000px" id="band">
        <p >The resulting Map Viewer not only highlights Cartographic Design, Symbology, and Scale Dependency for specific layers but also provides intuitive tools and functionalities for enhanced data exploration. With features such as interactive pop-ups, querying capabilities, and editing capabilities, the board members of The Conservancy can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions based on the ecological significance of the properties. When a property becomes available within the AOI, the board members will use this tool to assess its particular significance for preservation.
          The Filter Widget will allow the board members of the Conservancy to quickly analyze the distribution of specific data. Filters were set for layers such as Headwater areas and Site Suitability. As the board members interact with the sliding functionality, the Map view will adapt and transform accordingly, providing a visual representation of the filtered data. This feature greatly enhances the board members' experience and facilitates a deeper understanding of the distribution and characteristics of the Headwater areas.
          The attribute querying capability will allow the members of The Conservancy to obtain more information about attribute features such as Name, acreage, Land type, Township, and much more. The Edit tool will enable the Conservancy board members to easily update some layers as well as create new features directly on the Map Viewer without needing to use ArcGIS Pro. The Study Area and Scored Parcel Assessment layers have editing privileges set.
          The Measurement tool will help them identify the acreage of a certain parcel, as well as measure the distance from that parcel to ecologically significant areas such as Protected Lands, ANSIs, and PSWs, in order to justify the preservation of that land as necessary. The Export to PDF/Image widgets will allow the board members to export the map to PDF and images to include those
         
          maps in their Ecological Sensitivity and Baseline Documentation reports. These widgets were specifically requested by the client.
          The Basemap Gallery offers a variety of basemaps, including Imagery, Topographic, Terrain, and Streets. This valuable widget empowers the members of the Conservancy, allowing them to select and use any Basemap of their choice. With these options, they can easily identify features such as place names, major roads, streets, topology, water features and much more.</p>
